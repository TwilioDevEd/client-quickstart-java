# Twilio Client Quickstart for Java

## Set up

### Requirements

- [Java Development Kit](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) version 11 or later.
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own appointment reminder application. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config Value  | Description |
| :-------------  |:------------- |
`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/console).
`TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID` | The TwiML application with a voice URL configured to access your server running this app - create one [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/console/voice/twiml/apps). Also, you will need to configure the Voice "REQUEST URL" on the TwiML app once you've got your server up and running.
`TWILIO_CALLER_ID` | A Twilio phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) - you can [get one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming)
`API_KEY` / `API_SECRET` | Your REST API Key information needed to create an [Access Token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens) - create [one here](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/api-keys).

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/client-quickstart-java.git
    cd client-quickstart-java
    ```

2. Set your environment variables

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

3. Build the project

    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    **NOTE:** Running the build task will also run the tests

4. Run the application

    ```bash
    make serve
    ```
    **NOTE:** If you are using a dedicated Java IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you can start the application within the IDE and it will start in development mode, which means any changes on a source file will be automatically reloaded.

7. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

That's it!

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed on your machine, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` to setup your project.

1. Make sure you have the project cloned.
2. Setup the environmental variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file, see the [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings).
3. Run `docker-compose --env-file /dev/null up`.
4. Follow the steps in [Configure Twilio](#configure-twilio) section on how to expose your port to Twilio using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and configure the remaining parts of your application.

### Tests

You can run the tests locally by typing:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Configure Twilio

To let our Twilio Phone number use the callback endpoint we exposed our development server will need to be publicly accessible. [We recommend using ngrok to solve this problem](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html).

To start using `ngrok` in our project you'll have to execute the following line in the _command prompt_.

```
ngrok http 8080 -host-header="localhost:8080"
```

Keep in mind that our endpoint is:

```
http://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io/voice
```

[Configure your TwiML app](https://www.twilio.com//console/phone-numbers/dev-tools/twiml-apps)'s
Voice "REQUEST URL" to be your ngrok URL plus `/voice`. For example:

    ![screenshot of twiml app](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.twilio.prod.twilio-docs/images/TwilioClientRequestUrl.original.png)

You should now be ready to rock! Make some phone calls. Open it on another device and call yourself. Note that Twilio Client requires WebRTC enabled browsers, so Edge and Internet Explorer will not work for testing. We'd recommend Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox instead.

> **Note:** You must set your webhook urls to the `https` ngrok tunnel created.

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.

| Service                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
